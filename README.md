# Sixth C++ Assignment  

## Concepts: [Exception Handling, Abstract Classes, Dynamic Form Creation, Bureaucratic System Simulation]  

In this sixth assignment, we had to:  
- Implement a **Bureaucrat** class with rank-based restrictions and exception handling  
- Create a **Form** system with validation rules and ensure **proper access control**  
- Introduce an **abstract base class (AForm)** and derive multiple specialized forms (`ShrubberyCreationForm`, `RobotomyRequestForm`, `PresidentialPardonForm`)  
- Implement **exception-safe execution** of forms with grade-based access checks  
- Design an **Intern class** capable of dynamically creating different forms without hardcoded conditions  

This assignment reinforced **exception handling, object-oriented design, and dynamic memory management** in C++.
